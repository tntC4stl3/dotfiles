Dotfiles
========

My dotfiles for:
* vim
* tmux
* zsh
* git
* useful tools

## Quick Start
1. Install zsh, git, tmux, python-pip first.
2. run `./setup.sh`.

## Trouble shooting
1. Issue: `E319: Sorry, the command isn't available in this version: py << EOF  
   Solution: Need python2 support, `sudo apt install vim-nox-py2`
2. Issue: airline status not display correctly.
   Solution: Clone and install https://github.com/powerline/fonts, change the font in terminial setting.
